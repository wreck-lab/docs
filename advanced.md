The [Klipper Wiki](https://github.com/KevinOConnor/klipper/blob/master/docs/Overview.md) is the starting point to learn about all the Klipper functionalities and advanced features.

Here a short list of the some common topics:
- all the extended functionalities are documented in the [config file reference doc](https://www.klipper3d.org/Config_Reference.html) and they can be added to the printer configuration file
- the list of Klipper supported [commands and G-CODES](https://github.com/KevinOConnor/klipper/blob/master/docs/G-Codes.md)
- the [endstop phase detection](https://github.com/KevinOConnor/klipper/blob/master/docs/Endstop_Phase.md) algorithm which greatly improves the accuracy of the end stop switches. This aspect is very critical for Delta printers to achieve consistent first layers
- the [Delta Calibration Procedure](https://github.com/KevinOConnor/klipper/blob/master/docs/Delta_Calibrate.md) documentation
- the [Bed Levelling Procedure](https://github.com/KevinOConnor/klipper/blob/master/docs/Bed_Level.md) documentation
- the [sensorless homing]() supported by the printHAT. If you are willing to activate it follow the [instructions]. Not recommend for Delta printers due to the lower accuracy compared to regular end-stop switches.
