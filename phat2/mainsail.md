## Mainsail Settings
Mainsail configuration is almost ready to go out of the box. However, few little parts still need to be filled in since they describe your particular machine and can't be general (this is confirmed by the fact that the Mainsail dashboard is either not fully populated or displays error messages).  

To finalize the configuration, follow the steps in the [Configure Klipper](klipper) section.
