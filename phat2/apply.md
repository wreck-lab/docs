## Apply configuration changes

Once all the changes have been made Klipper needs to be restarted. This can be done from the web interface in the Klipper tab:
1. Start by restarting the “Firmware” first and then restart the “Host”.
2. If everything worked well you should get the message “Klipper state: Ready”. You can also probe the status by clicking the “Get Status” button.
When the printer is up and running it is advisable to run through the Klipper configuration [check-list](https://github.com/KevinOConnor/klipper/blob/master/docs/Config_checks.md)
