Let's start with a list of things you need:

- printHAT 2 control board
- Raspberry Pi 0/1/2/3/4 (RPi 2/3/4 are recommended for a smooth user experience)
- micro SD card (8GB or more)
- wrecklabOS software package

> **IMPORTANT**  
On **Raspberry Pi 4** we strongly recommend you use forced air cooling to cool both the Pi and the printHAT 2.
